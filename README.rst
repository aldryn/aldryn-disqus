but can be applied anywhere that you’d like to provide discussion functionality.

With the Aldryn Disqus Addon you can integrate it into your projects and start building an online community in just a
few simple steps.

`See it in action on the django CMS weblog <http://www.django-cms.org/en/blog/>`_.
